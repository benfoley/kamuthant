  <h1>GaayGaray</h1>

  <p><em>These are the Yuwaalaraay and Gamilaraay words for ‘word’.</em></p>

  <p>
    GaayGaray contains an extensive list of Gamilaraay and Yuwaalaraay words with definitions, sound and example sentences. Currently the content is from the 2002 Gamilaraay Yuwaalaraay Yuwaalayaay Dictionary. It will be updated to contain words developed since then, and corrections and additions to the original dictionary.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    The content of this app is the latest in a series of adaptations from the original dictionary by David Nathan. The first was for Gayarragi Winangali, where text was linked to sound, then for Ma!Gamilaraay, apps which are mostly no longer functional, and now for GaayGaray.
  </p>

  <p>
    The technical development of GaayGaray was done by Ben Foley, part of the CoEDL team working at the University of Queensland.
